# Python-Covid-Simulation
This was done as part of a larger project for my data structures class at California State University, Long Beach. 
Professor Oscar Morales Ponce laid out instructions for this lab.

### Instructions for Use:
Download the Zip and run the Covid.py file. This will run the simulation and produce matlib plots of the data in question.
